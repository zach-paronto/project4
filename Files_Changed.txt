Files Modified:
    -llnode.c: implementing linked list nodes
    -llnode.h: header file for llnode.c
    -wmap.c: created user level program to invoke system call -- not complete
    -Makefile: added wmap, wunmap, getpgdirinfo, getwmapinfo to OBJS
    -sysfile.c: sys call for wmap, wunmap, getpgdirinfo, getwmapinfo created
    -defs.h: added wmap, wunmap, getpgdirinfo, getwmapinfo
            also added structs for 2 get info functions
    -syscall.c: added defs for wmap, wunmap, getpgdirinfo, getwmapinfo
    -syscall.h: associations for SYS_wmap, SYS_wunmap, SYS_getpgdirinfo, SYS_getwmapinfo
    -wmap.h: init w given headers
    -wunmap.c: created user level program to invoke system call -- not complete
    -user.h: declarations for wmap, wunmap, getpgdirinfo, getwmapinfo
    -proc.h: added node struct, modified proc struct to store linked list of mapped memory
    -getwmapinfo.c: should be fully implemented. not tested yet.
    -getpgdirinfo.c: should be fully implemented. not tested yet.


NOTES:
    - I am unclear on this in the instructions, but it may be that all of our lengths are multiples of page size.
    If so, our implementation is much easier. If not, we may not be able to just round up the requested length 
    and store that in the node instead of whatever was requested. This will require only a few tweaks throughout the
    files to fix.
    To be clear, the code right now will store a node for a request of 0 to PAGE_SIZE bytes as PAGE_SIZE in length.
    This may or may not be allowed under the instructions.
